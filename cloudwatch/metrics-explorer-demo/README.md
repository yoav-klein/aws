# Metrics Explorer
---

The Metrics Explorer allows you to aggregate, filter and visualtize your metrics by tags and properties.

In this example, we'll create 4 EC2 instances, with the following tags:
- environment: prod, app: web
- environment: prod, app: auth
- environment: dev, app: web
- environment: dev, app: auth

Then, we'll explore the CPUUtilization of these instances based on environment, and based on app.
